            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="1">1. The firſt and moſt conſiderable Meaſure uſed by the Prelates to haſten our ruine, is that of <hi>Commiſſions:</hi> for under pretext of Executing the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes</hi> and the Decrees made in conſequence thereof, and providing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Breaches of the ſame, they have engaged the King to ſend Commiſſioners into all Provinces.

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> certain, that under this fair ſhow they have hid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> violent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48283:4"/>Injuſtice; for clearing whereof, we muſt remember, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of happy memory, having found it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient (for the quiet of his Subjects) to make this <hi>Edict</hi> as a particular and Irrevocable Law, did ſend Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners into all the Provinces to execute the ſame; and after thoſe Commiſſioners had eſtabliſhed all things in due form, they returned their executions into the hands of the King to ſerve as a Rule in all future Debates which could ariſe on that Subject. I grant, if ſince this Eſtabliſhment (which ought to be look'd upon as <hi>Fundamental</hi>) we have Uſurped Places for the excerciſe of our Religion, or by our own Authority have taken any thing not appertaining to us, it's juſt that they call us to an accompt, and reduce us to our firſt Condition. But this is not the uſe that the Clergy make of thoſe new <hi>Commiſſioners:</hi> for they well know that in ſtead of Uſurping any thing ſince the firſt Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Edict,</hi> we have (on the contrary) ſuſtain'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable loſſes; and that if the Plea were about <hi>Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of breaches of the <hi>Edict,</hi> they ſhould be obliged to recompence us in a thouſand particulars, whereof we have too juſt cauſe to complain. They have now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together perverted the Buſineſs; for, concealing the firſt Execution of the <hi>Edict,</hi> they have compelled all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches within the Kingdom, to appear before thoſe <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> and again produce their Titles to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie their Right for the publick exerciſe of their Religion and to be Judged a ſecond time, as if the <hi>Edict</hi> had never been put in Execution. But who doth not ſee that this is to violate the publick faith, and under pretence of Executing, to deſtroy the <hi>Edict</hi> for the <hi>Edict</hi> ought not to be ſeparated from it's firſt Execution, without which (it being made according to the true intent of the King, and after exact cognizance of all particulars, whereupon Sentences proceeded) the <hi>Edict</hi> it ſelf is of no force. This
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48283:4"/>then is moſt evident Oppreſſion, that after ſo many years, during which we have been in Lawful poſſeſſion, they will Judg again that which hath once already been Judged; in every thing quarrelling Matters of Fact, the knowledg whereof, by length of time, and divers Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Kingdom, is much obſcured. and (which is yet more ſtrange) albeit particular Churches produce Acts made in their favours, by the firſt <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> (Executors of the Edict) yet thoſe new <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> without any regard thereof, reiect the ſame as utterly Invalid; certainly if this manner of procedure take place, we can have nothing ſecure within the Kingdom. For from day to day they may proceed to new <hi>Executions,</hi> and from theſe to others, until, in end, all our Churches by this Mean ſhall be deſtroyed; ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no likely-hood that they can perpetually preſerve their Titles (of the years 1596 &amp; 1597) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Papers which by the Apoſtacy, Corruption, or Unfaithfulneſs of thoſe who had them in keeping (and a hundred other wayes) may be loſt; and which the firſt <hi>Execution</hi> made to be neglected as Titles that were never to be any more queſtioned,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Oppreſſion is the greater, That thoſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> are commanded to execute the Acts of Council, made in conſequence of the <hi>Edict:</hi> for (as we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew) theſe Acts are no other then ſo many Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Edict;</hi> which now by this courſe is nothing elſe but an empty Name, without effect or reallity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Maxime lately eſtabliſhed viz. That the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> ſhall be acknowledged as our formal oppoſite party in matters of Religion; and in that quality be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> and in the Council, to purſue all kinds of Actions againſt us, cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe looked upon, then high Injuſtice. This form of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48283:5"/>hath been hitherto unheard of; for never any appeared there in our affairs, except the Kings Attorney-General. And indeed, the <hi>Edist</hi> being intended not as an agreement or deciſion betwen the Clergy and us, but as a Declaration of his Majeſty's Sovereign and Royal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they have no right to interpoſe in the Execution thereof, nor to make that their proper work; yea, this Interpoſition hath not been invented but upon deſign, upon the meaneſt occaſion to ſet us in oppoſition to a moſt powerful and active Party, before which we can never appear without being incontinently ſwallow'd up.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This oppreſſion is yet the more evident, That the Council <hi>Anno</hi> 1662, paſt an Act, by which it is ordain'd, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhall not be admitted before the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> to prove the Rights for the exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Inqueſts or Witneſſes, even although the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be Roman-Catholicks. Now, beſide that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of probation was never rejected, what greater ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then to deprive us of the only Mean, which in moſt of places is left us to juſtifie our Titles? for during the late Wars, many Churches being pillaged or burnt, they cannot otherwiſe evidence their poſſeſſion, then by the teſtimony of ancient men yet alive, who can depoſe the Condition wherein Affairs ſtood in the years 1596, &amp; 1597.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whatever Injuſtice is in the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> it ſelf, there is no leſs in the <hi>Commiſſioners;</hi> Each Province hath two, the one a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the other a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> As for the Popiſh <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> we find by experience that from them we can expect no Juſtice; For they look upon themſelves as called to deſtroy us, and in effect proceed according to the Inſtructions of <hi>Menier</hi> the Jeſuit, who hath printed a Book, wherein, faſt'ning impertinent expoſitions upon the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms of the <hi>Edict,</hi> and changing his Majeſty's Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Royal words, into Jeſuitical Equivocations, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48283:5"/>hath perverted all things according to his own inclination; This is a notable Cheat: For when we plead the <hi>Edict,</hi> they tell us (indeed) that it ſhall be obſerved; but, that to the King, and not to us, belongs the interpretation; and when we come to an interpretation, in lieu of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's, they give us that of a cruel, envenom'd, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Jeſuit. He it is, who mean while inſpireth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Provinces (who are the <hi>Popiſh Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>) with all their prejudice they have at us, and Counſels they take about our affairs: So that our ſtrongeſt Reaſons are ſcorned, and our beſt Titles rejected as trifles, whil'ſt their own trifles and falſe Allegations are admitted as the beſt of Arguments. And, which is yet more ſtrange, they paſs Sentences with ſo much inequality, and little Juſtice, that they condemn ſome Churches, which produce the like and much better Titles then thoſe alledged by ſome other Churches, whoſe Priviledges they have ratified. A ſufficient demonſtration, that they act by Humour, and not by Reaſon; and that having order to preſerve ſome Churches, and not to deſtroy all at one Blow, it's left to the Governours Arbitrement, what Churches to ſpare, which commonly are the moſt inconvenient, and leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and that they only wait for further Order to ſacrifice the reſt, and perfect their work already ſo far advanced. And for the <hi>Proteſtant Commiſſioners,</hi> we can expect very little Juſtice and Protection from them; firſt, becauſe the greateſt part of them are choſen by direction and recommendation of the Biſhops, which alone is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make them ſuſpected: For, although they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Religion, yet that is not alwayes a ſure evidence of Faithfulneſs and Honeſty. For this, I ſhall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Monſieur Sigoniac</hi> of high <hi>Guyenne,</hi> who was choſen by the Biſhop of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and by his credit maintained in his Commiſſion, contrary to the diſſent of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48283:6"/>made before the King. This man after he had done whatever the Clergy deſired, and baſely betray'd the Churches, by pitiful parting or ſharing<note n="*" place="margin">By this <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> it ſeems the <hi>Protestants</hi> are forced to uſe their publick worſhip by turnswith the <hi>Papists</hi> in the ſame place; whereunto (for diverſe reaſons) ſome more tender and zealous <hi>Protestants</hi> will not reſort; and ſo are deprived of all publick worſhip.</note> the places of Publick Worſhip between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant's</hi> (whereunto the Biſhop himſelf gave conſent) in end, changing his Religion, became <hi>Romane Catholick;</hi> and by his change declared, That this Commiſſion had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in compenſation of his former Promiſe and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that effect.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, the <hi>Proteſtant Commiſſioners</hi> are prepoſſeſſed of opinion, That it is the Kings will, that without reſpect to the firſt execution of the <hi>Edict,</hi> they ſhould examine <hi>de novo</hi> the Titles of our Churches, and execute the Acts of Council, without examination whether they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by, or conform to the <hi>Edict:</hi> So that having once accepted the Commiſſion, they find themſelves engag'd by neceſſity of this ſuppoſition to do us abundance of miſchief. And it is to be obſerved, that ſuch hath been the credit and cunning carriage of the Clergy, that by means of this Concurrence of the <hi>Proteſtant Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> they have made theſe things paſs as conſented to, and approved by us, which otherwiſe would have been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as only granted by the King unto their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and ſo (perhaps) would, have left us ſome hope, of redreſs. In fine, ſuppoſe thoſe Commiſſioners to be reſolute and favourably inclined, yet the Governours of the Provinces being Maſters of the Inſtructions, by which they proceed and conclude, they can do no good for us, but be ſwallow'd up themſelves, by their <hi>Popiſh Colleagues,</hi> who have all the Authority and Power in their own hands. And at their utmoſt, all that they are able to effect, is a

               <hi>Sharing</hi> of Churches, which are alwayes finally Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd in Council, by advice of the <hi>Popiſh Commiſſioners:</hi> For there they obſerve this general Rule, that in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of difference and debate, the advantages, without regard to right of reaſon, muſt be given to the <hi>Catholicks;</hi> So that if the buſineſs comes once to <hi>Sharing</hi> it is even as good as loſt. And to evidence that Injuſtice is arrived at a great hight, Theſe <hi>Sharings</hi> of Churches agreed upon amongſt the Commiſſioners, are ordinarily concluded in Council, upon the report of the Governours, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made and being engaged to maintain their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, never fail to put a good face upon them, which they may the more eaſily do, becauſe their <hi>Proteſtant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues</hi> are never either Called or Heard. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe Commiſſions have been generally very fatal to the Reform'd Churches within the kingdom: For it may be truely affirmed, that partly by the Acts made with common conſent of the Comiſſioners for executing the Decrees of Counſel, partly by theſe other Acts which they have made worſe then the Decrees themſelves, and partly by theſe <hi>Sharings</hi> of Churches thus agreed upon among the Commiſſioners, and approved in Council, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of the Clergy, <hi>we have loſt well nigh three parts of four of all our Churches.</hi> The Province of <hi>Provence</hi> which had Fifteen or Sixteen Churches, is now reduced to Four. The County of <hi>Gex,</hi> which had Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three hath now but Two. In all <hi>Bretagne</hi> remains but Two. The loſſes of high and low <hi>Languedoc</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cevenes Vivaretz, <hi>high</hi> Guynne <hi>&amp;</hi> Daulphine</note> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them at leaſt to one half of what they formerly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. And (to ſpeak nothing of what <hi>Zantogne Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois,</hi> and the County of <hi>Aulnix</hi> are upon the point of loſing, the Commiſſioners having agreed to <hi>Share</hi> nigh Sixty Churches) the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> which alone had Sixty one indiſputable Churches, by an Act of <hi>Aug.</hi> 6. 1665.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48283:7"/>is reduced to Thirteen. Thus theſe Provinces ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, all at once, fallen into extreme Deſolation; Their Churches demoliſhed, their Flocks ſcatter'd, and all that innumerable Multitude of Perſons whereof their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were compoſed, now neceſſitated either to live without any publick Exerciſe of Religion; or, through infinite Dangers and Inconveniences, to wander about, and ſeek it Fifty or Sixty miles diſtant from their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

Moreover, All men know, that the Clergy finding themſelves of late in capacity to obtain whatever they deſired of the Council, provided it be againſt us, have cauſed ſuch a multitude of Acts to be publiſhed, that we have been utterly overwhelmed therewith; a Second im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following the Firſt, and a Third giving us no leaſure to conſider the Second; and hard to ſay, which of them all is the moſt Afflicting.</p>
            <p>One Act of Council<note n="a" place="margin">May 6. 1659, and March 17. 1661.</note> hath robbed us the Liberty of Praiſing God, by forbidding the Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> even privately in our Houſes; not conſidering, That it is an Eminent part of Chriſtian Worſhip, very Edifying, and full of Piety.</p>

            <p>But we might reckon to a Century, and engage our ſelves in a prodigious length, ſhould we be exact in this ſad Subject. One word onely of the Declaration<note n="p" place="margin">Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 1663, Ratified in Parl. Ian. 7. 1663</note> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Relapſes. By this it is ordained, That thoſe among us who have once embraced the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, ſhall never again return unto us, under pain of perpetual Baniſhment from the Kingdom. Now this is a ſort of Inquiſition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of in <hi>France,</hi> by which they put mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48283:8"/>upon the wrack, conſtraining the Weak who have been overcome by ſtrong Tentations, to remain in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion againſt the light of their Conſciences, and to ſtifle their remorſe, having no liberty to ſhew any evidence of Repentance. A thing plainly contrary to the <hi>Edict.</hi> Yea, in the Execution of this Declaration, they have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far, that they have given it a <hi>Retroactive</hi> Power (as they call it) by putting it in Execution againſt perſons who returned to us a long time before the Declaration was in being; whom they have Impriſoned, compelled to do Penance<note n="*" place="margin">By go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed thorow the ſtreets with a burning torch, to the place of Iuſtice, or perſon offended, and there to ask Forgiveneſs.</note>, and then baniſhed the Kingdom. And, that they may not act this Cruelty without a pretext, they alledg, That theſe perſons by forſaking the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> have ſo violated the reſpect which they owe it, that they deſerve Exemplary Puniſhment. This is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to deſtroy all <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. To theſe Afflictions they have added another, not leſs grievous to us, which is, That they ſeem to forbid us all hope of being heard in our own Defence: For our Judges themſelves are become formally our Party, either becauſe they are afraid to encounter the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> a Party now ſo formidable to the World; or becauſe themſelves are of that Party; or becauſe they perceive that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to advance their own Intereſt, is to Oppreſs us; as on the contrary, to do us the leaſt Juſtice, or ſhew any commiſeration of our Afflictions, is reputed a puniſhable Crime. I ſhall not inſiſt upon the furious paſſion expreſt againſt us by the <hi>Provincial Parliaments,</hi> although arrived at ſuch a height, as nothing can either reſtrain or mitigate it. Nevertheleſs, we cannot but heavily groan under their daily Injuries, the Number and Violence whereof is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceivable. All <hi>France</hi> knoweth the Decrees which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48283:9"/>the Inferior Parliaments of <hi>Tholouze, Rouen, Rennes, Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de aux, Pau, Provence, Dijon,</hi> and <hi>Metz,</hi> have already made, and which (with all greedineſs embracing every occaſion to pour out their Wrath upon us) they are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making againſt us. Neither ſhall I ſpeak of the Malice of Inferior Courts, there being ſcarce any petty Countrey Juſtice who doth not expect to raiſe his Reputation, and make himſelf Illuſtrious by perſecuting of us. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance one thing, hardly credible, though very true, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no hope of being heard at the Council it ſelf, where all our Affairs have their laſt Appeal and Audience: For it hath often come to paſs, That the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Deputies, ſent by the Provinces and Cities to plead their Cauſe, have been expreſly commanded by the King to return, without ſo much as only liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Thus in the year 1661, <hi>Monſieur Vignolles,</hi> deputed by the Province of <hi>Low-Languedoc,</hi> to ſolicite their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, was no ſooner arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> but he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Expreſs, to withdraw within Eight days, under pain of Diſobedience. Likewiſe <hi>Anno</hi> 1664, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Privas</hi> having Commiſſioned <hi>Monſieur de la Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe</hi> to Negotiate their Buſineſs, he no ſooner appeareth, but the Captain of the Watch intimates to him the King's Order to return preſently into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> under the ſame pain. And the laſt year, (1665,) the Province of <hi>Low-Guyenne,</hi> having deputed <hi>Monſieur de Sarran</hi> for the ſame effect, immediately thereafter, he received a Letter under the Seal, prohibiting him to come to Court. By which it is abundantly evident, That they have no mind to hear us, and leſs to do us Juſtice. And if other Commiſſioners have not been treated after this manner, yet they very well know what Repulſes they have endured. What dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties before they had acceſs but to the Dores of the Judges? What pains to find but one Commiſſioner wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48283:9"/>to receive and preſent their Petitions? And when thorow Importunity they have ſo far prevailed, they likewiſe know what kind of Hearing they have obtained; Their beſt Arguments have been rejected, and moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Probations contemned, whilſt the ſlighteſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alledged by their Adverſaries, have been admitted with great applauſe. So that ſome have ſpent ſix months, ſome whole years to procure a Hearing; whilſt the Acts ſued againſt Us by the Clergy, have been obtain'd in leſs then twenty four hours; and in end after a thouſand cares and vexations, they have only had the grief to return to their Provinces, with the news of the loſs of the Cauſe, which they ſolicited.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This is not all. The malice of the Clergy goeth yet much higher; for, it is well known how they endeavour to intimidate and affright our Miniſters, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and diſturb them in the care which they ſhould have of their flocks. Thus they have violently Silenced ſome, others they labour to enſnare upon every hand, ſome they criminally indite for very trifles, ſome they baniſh, and ſome they tranſport whither the Prelats pleaſe; and all this to make their Life and Condition ſo miſerable, that henceforth no man may be willing to embrace the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Calling of a Miniſter. The Provinces of <hi>France</hi> are ſo full of ſuch Examples, that to relate them all would ſwell to a large Volume.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Theſe Cities where Proteſtants for number are moſt conſiderable, ſeem to be the principal object of our Enemies fury; and eſpecially thoſe which during the late Commotions were zealous in his Majeſty's ſervice. Of theſe, <hi>Montauban, Rochel,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> formerly three flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Churches, but now reduced to extream deſolation, are moſt doleful Examples. <hi>Montauban</hi> being firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Univerſity and Common Council, hath
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48283:10"/>endured a Gariſon of five or ſix thouſand Soldiers for four months together; hath ſeen her Inhabitants, ſome hanged, ſome burnt, ſome ſcourg'd, ſome baniſhed; the Houſes of others pulled down, and Pyramides erected in their place; others compelled by beating, and all manner of Violence, to go to Maſs, and in end forced to accept an Act of Oblivion for an Imaginary Crime. For in all that Tumult alledged againſt them, there was not one Sword drawn, one Piſtol diſcharg'd, one Hat pierced, nor one drop of blood ſpilt; it having only been a Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly according to the ordinary Cuſtom, from which a Meſſenger was diſpatched to the Governour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, intreating the delay of the execution of an Order, to ſurrender to the Jeſuits the publick Schools of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, which being built at their own expences, did law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully belong to themſelves; and that only until ſuch time as they ſhould preciſely know his further pleaſure with proteſtation, that thereafter they would intirely ſubmit themſelves. This is the crime for which they have been uſed with the ſame cruelty, as if they had Rebelled againſt the State, and ever ſince have been expoſed as a prey to the rage of the Prieſts, who exerciſe mercileſs Tyranny upon the poor Inhabitants. <hi>Milan</hi> hath received almoſt the ſame meaſure, for no other cauſe then burying a dead Corps after the accuſtom'd manner, contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Decree,</hi> which prohibits the performance of that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and ſorrowful Office to the Dead in that manner. And as for <hi>Rochel,</hi> all <hi>France</hi> knoweth the Baniſhment of ſome of the Inhabitants, and cruel enſlaving of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to ſuch rigour as is worſe then Baniſhment it ſelf. But all this is nothing to what is done at <hi>Privas:</hi> In this Town, although the Reformed Religion had been eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Authority of the late King, and the Inhabitants maintained in that Eſtabliſhment by ſeveral Decrees; yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48283:10"/>after Thirty two, or Thirty three years peaceable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they are now baniſhed the Town and Territories thereof, with ſuch Inhumanity, as they have not exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon <hi>Barbarians.</hi> This poor people, to the number of Five or ſix hundred Men, Women and Children, being ſpoiled of all their Goods, and miſerably hunted from place to place, like very Beaſts, are now wandring in Woods, without any certain place to this day<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> The time of writing of this Relation.</note>, where to ſettle and reſt: And all this without any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence than an old Declaration <hi>Anno</hi> 1629, relating to the Commotions of the year 1627.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Whatever brevity we propoſed in this Diſcourſe, yet we cannot but reflect upon another Device, whereof our Adverſaries every where make uſe to render our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition inſupportable, and that is, to Vex and Ruin us with Civil and Criminal Law-Suits, as well againſt the body of our Church as particular perſons; ſomtimes in the name of the King's General Attorneys, or their Subſtitutes; ſometimes in the name of Dioceſan, or Monaſtick Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or their Chapters: and all this, oftentimes, for things utterly falſe, as, That we have ſpoken Irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the holy Sacraments, or ſuch like enormous Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures. For proving of all which, they never want Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and falſe Witneſſes. And if at any time the Forgery be diſcovered, the Judges ſeldom puniſh the Authors; or if they inflict any Puniſhment at all, it is but ſuch as through the ſlightneſs thereof giveth greater liberty and encouragement to ſuch perſons. What Juſtice was there done upon a Prieſt of <hi>Eymet</hi> in <hi>Low-Guyenne,</hi> who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral Inhabitants of that place, of having profaned the Myſteries of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, although the Judges, in end, found and acknowledged the falſhood of the Accuſation? What Juſtice was done upon another Prieſt of <hi>Chaſtelleraut,</hi> who accuſed an innocent Maid of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48283:11"/>expreſſing ſome diſreſpect to the King's Perſon, although the Judges did likewiſe acknowledg the impoſture of the Prieſt, and falſhood of the Accuſation? What reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was there ever made to the Name and Memory of a poor Man, who was accuſed before the Parliament of <hi>Rennes,</hi> and by Sentence thereof, <hi>Burnt alive,</hi> for alledged ſtealing a Chalice out of the Church, although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after themſelves made it evident, by putting three Thieves to death, who had committed the theft, that they had murthered an innocent perſon? What pitiful Juſtice did the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouze</hi> lately upon a wicked fellow, convict before them of having ſuborned falſe Witneſſes to depoſe againſt a Merchant of <hi>Montauban,</hi> that he had blaſphemed the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> He was (forſooth) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a hundred <hi>Liures</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This is about 7. <hi>lib.</hi> ſterl.</note> fine or damage, and that was all the puniſhment. What ſatisfaction hath there been made to <hi>Monſieur Bobineau,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Puzange</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> who was falſely accuſed by a Curate, of Seditious Preaching, and upon that pretended crime, was detained two months Priſoner in the Common Goal of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> although the accuſation was found falſe, and the Accuſers convict of Forgery? What Cruelty was exerciſed upon <hi>Monſieur Boxie,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Turenne,</hi> who being ſhut up in a cloſe Dungeon with Irons upon his feet, was for a whole year treated with all manner of Barbarous Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and thereafter condemned to perpetual Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by <hi>Decree</hi> of the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sept. 5. 1664.</note>? In which Act it is declar'd that from his words in a Sermon, they had ſome ground to draw conſequences, reflecting upon the honour of the Bleſſed Virgin; whereas (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) he had uttered nothing in the Sermon, but that none except Jeſus Chriſt, was born without ſin. What puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was put upon <hi>Monſieur Faiſon,</hi> Baily of <hi>Privas,</hi> who before the Juſtice Court of <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> was convict of falſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48283:11"/>accuſing ſome Inhabitants of <hi>Privas,</hi> as if they had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and hindred their Brethren from changing their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? And what Juſtice was done upon a Prieſt of <hi>Nyort,</hi> convict before the King's Council, of falſifying an Act of Parliament, which being made againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>Mer,</hi> he would have executed againſt thoſe of <hi>Nyort?</hi> Although there was never a more bold Cheat, in the very face of King and Council; yet in ſtead of puniſhing the Author, the buſineſs ended in laughter.</p>
            <p n="12">12. When theſe falſe Accuſations and foul convictions are made appear to the Judges, in lieu of Puniſhment, they tell us, That they muſt reſpect the Honour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion; not conſidering that they ſhould much better preſerve it by puniſhing theſe Impoſtures which diſgrace it, then (as their trade now is) by deſtroying ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt people, by ſuch practices, horrible in themſelves, and odious to the World. But it plainly appears, that the deſign of this Popiſh Cabal is, by all means and ways to cruſh and bear us down, until being wearied, diſheartned, and impoveriſh'd by ſuch a long tract of miſeries and croſs affairs, we become utterly unable to defend our ſelves, and then in end, being overcome with tentation, ſeek our peace in the ruin of our Conſciences.</p>

I ſhall add a word further of the Liberty granted to Prieſts and Monks (whoſe Nature without encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is forward enough) to inſult over us, to commit all manner of Violence and Injuſtice, without fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yea, and to execute the Acts of Council againſt us, as now they do in <hi>Poictou;</hi> where the Prieſts, running from place to place with unparallel'd Barbarity, demoliſh Churches, dig up and ſearch the very loweſt ſtones of the Foundation, break open Cheſts, carry away the Poors Moneys, pull down particular Mens Houſes, and the Caſtles of our Gentry, moſt ſpitefully abuſing their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48283:12"/>with all manner of injurious words, and violent actions.</p>
            <p n="14">14. There is nothing more ſtrange then the ways which thoſe men take to make Proſelytes; For, neglecting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and good Example, (which are the only proper and lawful means of gaining Souls to God) they only uſe Promiſes, Threatnings, and labour to catch men by ſnares. Is a Woman at variance with her Husband? thither they run and offer her the Protection of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, provided ſhe will embrace it. Is a man decayed, and his Eſtate diſordered? immediately they promiſe to bear him up againſt his Creditors, and mountains of Gold, if he will but change his Religion. Is there a debauched Son, and diſobedient to his Father? they'r preſently with him, perſwading him to change his Religion, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the favour and protection of the Church. Hath any man an unjuſt Suit at Law like to go againſt him? Is another juſtly purſued for his Crimes? their ſureſt refuge is their change of Religion. Is a man poor or ſick in a Hoſpital?<note place="margin">A <hi>Daniſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded in an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, was ſolicited to change his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which, when he would not do, they counterfeited the Apparition of Devils, with a Death's head, wherein they had put a light. Thoſe ſeigned ſpirits, having ſeveral times ſpoken to this Young-man, thus, That he was damned if he would not turn Roman-Catholick; in end, they ſo afrighted him, that he dyed the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1666.</note> let him but change his Religion, and he ſhall be ſure of kindneſs and good entertainment; but if he remain ſtedfaſt, he ſhall be abandoned, and die in miſery. Thus thoſe men ſhew their zeal to propagate their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; or rather, and more truly, thus they ſcandalize and damnifie it. For while by theſe ways they labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſame, they but add to their fellowſhip ſuch vile perſons, as having changed upon ſuch baſe Motives will never do good among them.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Nothing can be added to the rigour continually
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48283:12"/>exerciſed againſt us thorow all the Kingdom, whereby they deprive us of all means of acquiring a Livelihood, and all hopes of Preferment, there being no admittance of us unto any publick Office (except thoſe of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Edict</hi>) no, not ſo much as to the petty Offices of a Notary, Attorney, or Serjeant; nor yet to learn Arts and Trades. For, although the King by his <hi>Decree, Jun.</hi> 28. 1665. permitteth Proteſtants as well as Papiſts, to learn Arts and Trades, by way of Apprentiſhip; yet by the oppoſition which is made, when particular perſons offer themſelves, whereby they are involved in tedious Suits of Law, the expences whereof in end, ruin them, the execution of that <hi>Decree</hi> is obſtructed, and the <hi>Decree</hi> it ſelf without effect. So that even the Priviledg which the King was pleaſed to grant us, is become a ſnare, and ends in our ruin, by the perverſeneſs of thoſe to whom the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the <hi>Decree</hi> was committed.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Theſe things being conſidered, it may be truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed without unjuſt aggravation, That the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> are reduced to the greateſt extremity of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable miſery; being without Help, without Comfort, without hope of Juſtice, overpreſt with troubles, and deſtitute of all relief, having ſcarce the liberty of praying unto, or being inſtructed in the Knowledg of God; So that indeed there is nothing left but the Life, and that is nothing elſe but a ſorrowful Breath, drawn from a more ſorrowful and afflicted Heart, whereof were they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deprived, they ſhould be ſo much the more eaſed and happy, for, then ſhould they reſt in peace, having no ſorrows, nor fears. And yet the Clergy not contented to ſee them in this deplorable Eſtate, muſt needs have them utterly deſtroyed, and therefore will never give over their deſign until they have accompliſhed it.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:48283:13"/>
            <p n="17">17. And to make this evident, there needs no more, but read an Oration made by the Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſez</hi> before the King, in name of the whole Clergy: Wherein, having firſt rendred thanks to his Majeſty for what he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done againſt us, and then petitioned him for a preſent Declaration, prohibiting Catholicks to embrace the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and for another <hi>Decree,</hi> Incorporating the mixed Courts (which conſiſting of half Proteſtants, and half Papiſts, had been eſtabliſhed in favour of the Proteſtants) into the Courts of Parliaments; in end, he exhorts, perſwades, and adjures him by all the moſt moving Arguments, that he would now give the laſt blow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our utter deſtruction, ſeeing he was now able and in capacity to effect it. I hope the King will beware to follow Counſels ſo terrible and violent; and am ſure would have been much more edified had he ſeen the Biſhops more Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, more Chriſtian, and more agreeable to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. But here we yet ſee their deſign, and what we may juſtly expect, from a Party equally powerful and maliciouſly inflamed againſt us.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That our miſeries may be yet more piercing, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice they add deriſion and ſcoffs, and by thoſe who have done us the greateſt injuries, publiſh abroad, that we are marvelouſly well uſed, and have all reaſon to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their Moderation. This is evidence ſufficient that they are far from repairing our loſſes, when having left us but very little, even that Little muſt paſs as an Act of Grace.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Our Fears are doubled. When (upon the one hand) we conſider, That all the <hi>Sharings</hi> of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Determinations of Council againſt us, have been made and concluded without any regard of the Titles produced by our Churches; then which, none could be better, or more convincing; ſuch as, The Books and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters of Marriages and Baptiſms, the very years of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48283:13"/>
               <hi>Edict, Conſiſtorial Acts, Acts</hi> or <hi>Inſtruments of Notaries;</hi> the Appearance of theſe Churches before <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> and <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> 1596, and 1597: and I know not how many more Evidences of the like nature. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all which, they proceeded to Sentence againſt us. And (upon the other hand) when we ſee the Province of <hi>Bearn</hi> ſo cruelly uſed by the Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> that after innumerable Severities againſt both Miniſters, and their Flocks, wherein they went ſo far, as to make Acts againſt Miniſters for not admitting to the Lords Supper flagitious perſons, Synodally ſuſpended for their ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous lives; The ſaid Parliament, in end, hath formally ſtated themſelves their Oppoſite Party, and (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things very ſtrange, and never heard of) have peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the King for the Extermination of the Reformed Religion out of the whole Province. And when we ſee that the Clergy of <hi>Bearn</hi> by their Petition agreeing with the Parliaments, have required the very ſame things which the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> required, in that Oration of the Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſez,</hi> made before the King, and now publiſhed in Print: When (I ſay) we ſee and conſider theſe things, have we not juſt cauſe to fear, That more dreadful Calamities then we have yet ſeen, are preparing for us. Moreover, is not the preſent Deſolation of the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> a moſt aſtoniſhing and terrible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? In all that vaſt Dioceſs of <hi>Luſon,</hi> they have not left ſo much as one Church. So that the greateſt part of our Brethren are forced to travel above Fifty and Sixty Miles to hear the Word; and to expoſe their new-born Infants (in order to Baptiſm) to manifold Dangers. And the reſt of the Province is but very little better treated, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Thirteen Churches allowed for above a Hundred thouſand perſons of our Religion. In fine, Are not our Fears very reaſonable, and well grounded, when we ſee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48283:14"/>that the Proteſtants, contrary to the very words of the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and without regard of their Priviledges have been formally ſubjected to that great Court of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Seſſions,</hi> which the King hath erected in the City of <hi>Clermont;</hi> and eſpecially, if ye add, That the Heads of that Superſtitious Cabal are now ſecretly at work, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Subſcriptions thorow all <hi>France,</hi> unto a League for perſecuting of us with all Severity. Theſe things make us juſtly apprehenſive, that, in end, they will break out in acts of open Violence; there being nothing which they are not in caſe to undertake for accompliſhing of our Ruine. And unleſs we be wilfully blind, we cannot but ſee, that they deſign to drive us (by Deſpair) into ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: (But that we ſhall never do; preferring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer the greateſt Extremity, and our very. Blood to be ſhed, then in the leaſt to violate the reſpect which we owe to our Prince.) And if they cannot overcome our Patience, (as aſſuredly they never ſhall) then their Reſolution is, By continual Importunity to prevail with His Majeſty to drive us out of the Kingdom. But we hope that the King is ſo Good and Juſt, that he will never gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them in ſuch a thing, without a Parallel. And if we ſhould be called to ſuch a Trial, we hope God will give us ſuch Strength and Courage, as, without regret, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our Native Land, that we may ſerve him wherever his Providence ſhall call us. And this, in effect, is the general Reſolution of all the PROTESTANTS with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom.</p>
